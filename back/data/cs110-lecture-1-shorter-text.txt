Guiding Principles For This Quarter
     We are each starting the new year in unique circumstances.
     We are likely not fully recovered or restored from the stresses of the past 2 years and
     now facing new uncertainties, responsibilities, and emotions.
     We will do everything we can to support you. We have designed the course to the best
     of our ability to provide flexibility.
     We will constantly evaluate and listen to ensure the class is going as smoothly as
     possible for everyone.
     Please communicate with us if any personal circumstances or issues arise! We are
     here to support you.

                                                                                              5

What is CS110?
CS107 took you behind the scenes:
    how things work inside C++/Python/Java, and how your programs map onto the
    components of computer systems
    understanding of program behavior and execution

                                                                                6

What is CS110?
CS107 took you behind the scenes:
    how things work inside C++/Python/Java, and how your programs map onto the
    components of computer systems
    understanding of program behavior and execution

CS110 uses this as a foundation to build complex programs that maximally take
advantage of the hardware and operating system software available to us:
    How can we understand the designs and tradeoffs of large systems?
    How can we write software that spans multiple machines?
    How can we write software that runs tasks in parallel on a single machine?

                                                                                6

Prerequisites
CS107 or equivalent -
     Each of you should know C and C++ reasonably well so that you can...
         write moderately complex programs (e.g. pointers, malloc/realloc/free, C strings,
         C++ classes, methods, references, templates, new/delete)
         read and understand portions of large code bases
         trace memory diagrams and always win!
     Each of you should be fluent with Unix, GDB, Valgrind, and Make to the extent they're
     covered in CS107 or its equivalent.

                                                                                            7

The first assignment is meant to give you a sense of the scope of CS110 programs and refresh your
memory on relevant prerequisites. If you feel ok about it, you're all set!
